I use a virtualenv, use it too if you want. I added some common venv directories
to the gitignore, so name it one of those or add your own's name to the file.

install the dependencies from requirements.txt (this is subject to change, so
do this after pulling too)

Once you have Flask, etc, in the command line run:
  export FLASK_APP=app/app.py
  flask run
